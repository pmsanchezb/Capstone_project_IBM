## Introduction

I am considering in opennning a new hotel in Bogota (Colombia), as part of an expansion project of my business. Unfortunately, I don't know the city and I would like to explore the different neighbothoods in order to settle the new hotel in the best place.

I am looking for a neighborhood with a lot of visitors, for whatever purpose they want (Business or pleasure) and near to touristic places.

## Business Problem

The data I am gonna use is the neighborhood data avalilable in wilkipedia. Bogotá is a big city with more than 6 million of inhabitants. The city is divided into 20 localities, each locality has major areas called UPZs that contain the neighborhoods.

The method for data extraction is going to be web scraping and ideally I expect through clustering identify the best neighborhood to start my new hotel.
